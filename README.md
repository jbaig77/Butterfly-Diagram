This is a project I'm working under Dr.Ofer Cohen at UML as a reseach assitant.

The purpose of this project is to possibly explain the butterfly diagram, using the dipole coordinates of sunspots.

This code for this project used python3, and is based off of A. C. Fraser-Smith's paper, "Centered and Eccentric Geomagnetic Dipoles and Their Poles, 1600-1965", which looks at the dipole coordinates of the Earth.
